# ZAOC

A little ISPF helper tool for when you are solving Advent of Code with REXX.
Also has my solutions in ADVENT.SOLVE.REXX.

If you wanna clone/use this see notes below

## Features

- Instantly download the puzzle input for any given day in any given year
- Primes a REXX solver for both parts for that day in that year
- That reads the input file

## Easy Config

Rename the ADVENT.CONFIG.EXAMPLE and change the values to match your systems setup and your session-cookie 

## TODO

- Fire the solution to AoC
- Update the table to show how many tries on a day/part
    
## Cloning?
This repo is not really ready for clonage as usage :)
Yes you can clone and use yourself.. but please work from the 'starthere' branch.
If you clone master, with all my solutions and you 'ADD' you data... my solutions will be overwritten I think. 
I haven't tested it.
